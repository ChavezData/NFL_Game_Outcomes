## Motivation

Predicting the result of an NFL game is a challenging task that involves accounting for many variables â€” team strength, injuries, schedule, etc. This project aims to:

- Explore historical NFL data  
- Engineer features that might influence game outcomes  
- Train predictive models  
- Evaluate and compare model performance  
- Provide insights into what drives predictive accuracy
